This project makes use of a mesh styled P2P network.
Due to the fact that implementing this architecture using real IP addresses would be
very time consuming and would go out of the scope of our project we decided to
adapt our model to run on our loopback IP address (127.0.0.1) with our different nodes
connecting through different port numbers starting on 8000 onwards. We chose this number
because it's out of the known ports range used for most commun services required by our
machines.
Given that that this network must be decentralized, in accordance to web3 technology,
our nodes must serve as both clients and servers, meaning they will be sending eachother
information, and in turn will simultaneously be listening for their peer's messages.
We decided that the way we wanted to organize information sent from each node would be to
add a prefix header in the beginning of each message. This header has only two characters,
a letter followed by a semi-colon. This way we were able to implement logic and algorithms
depending on the header that was recieved.
We can see on figure (add figure number) that all nodes both send and recieve these messages
with appropriate headers.
